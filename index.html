  <h1>News UK Archives</h1>
	<img src="front page.jpg" alt="News UK Archives">
  	<h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p>The News Archives is the archives of News UK, publishers of The Times, The Sunday Times and The Sun as well as other now defunct papers. The News Archives consist of three collections: photographs; newspapers and cuttings; and documents and artefacts.</p>
	<h2> Photographic archive</h2>
	<img src="photographic.jpg">
<p>The photographic archive is the largest part of our collections, and it encompasses a century of press photography from early glass plate negatives from the First World War up through the 1950s to 35mm film and the emergence of digital photography in the 1990s. The collection contains over 14 million digital images, 25 million prints and 50 million negatives. </p>
<p>It is regarded as one of the largest newspaper photography archives in the country. As you would expect the collection captures news events and world figures, but it also records a social history of Britain in the 20th and 21st centuries including people at work and play, people in protest, culture, street scenes, country landscapes, fashion, and sport.</p>
<p>In 2017 we completed a project to digitise and transcribe the photographic negative diaries and index cards and uploaded 886,000 entries to our digital assets management system which has greatly improved our ability to search this huge resource.</p>
<p>The collection, like most photography archives, is only partially digitised due to its sheer scale, however, this provides a great opportunity to discover unpublished material.
</p>

<h2> Bound Volumes and Cuttings</h2>

<p>We still print in hard copy, so we maintain hard copy back files of our national and regional editions which we bind. We have around 12 000 bound volumes of all our titles both past and present.</p> 
<p>The collection also holds an estimated 8 million cuttings from both our own and opposition papers. We stopped adding to the cuttings collection in 2008, as everything is now available digitally, but the collection is still in regular use as it predates most electronic newspaper databases and can be a goldmine when editorial is writing obituaries for example.</p>

<h2> Historical Archive aka The Vault</h2>
	<img src="vault.jpg">
<p>Our holdings in what we call the “historical archive” go back to the title deeds for John Walter buying the King’s Printing House in Blackfriars in 1784 where he founded The Times, and they go right up to the present day.</p> 
<p>We have a variety of holdings from internal and external correspondence, memoranda and reports to advertising posters and films, art and artwork, and a large artefact collection ranging from linotype machines and satellite phones to medals, trophies, a walking stick…and even a sperm whale tooth. </p>
<p>The company has had a structured records management system since 1981, and in addition to the historic collection, we have around 32000 boxes in our records management system. </p>
<p>These three collections combined form an unparalleled resource within the British newspaper industry. They are used right across the company - editorial are obviously big users, but pretty much every part of the business from Licensing to commercial and marketing to our legal teams, HR, Corporate Affairs and Wireless and Times Radio, comes into contact with the archives as part of its current activities.</p>
